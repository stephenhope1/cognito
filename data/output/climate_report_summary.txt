**The Final Warning: An Urgent Synthesis of the IPCC Climate Report**

It is unequivocal: human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, causing widespread and rapid changes to the climate system. The latest synthesis report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that global surface temperature has already risen by approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, fuelling the unprecedented and intensifying extreme weather events—from heatwaves to floods—witnessed across the globe.

The report issues a stark warning that without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C will be beyond reach. To secure this critical threshold, global greenhouse gas emissions must be nearly halved by 2030. The window for decisive action is rapidly closing.

Furthermore, many climate impacts are already unavoidable and irreversible on human timescales. These 'locked-in' changes include continued ocean warming, irreversible ice sheet melt, and centuries of relentless global mean sea level rise, guaranteeing future risk for coastal communities worldwide.

Yet, the report also provides a clear and hopeful message: deep, rapid, and sustained emissions reductions are possible. Viable, effective, and increasingly affordable solutions now exist across all sectors to achieve the necessary transformation. The choices made in this decade will secure a liveable and sustainable future for all—or they will not.
