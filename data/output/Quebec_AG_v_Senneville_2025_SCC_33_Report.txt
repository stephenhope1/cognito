### Comprehensive Report on Quebec (Attorney General) v. Senneville, 2025 SCC 33

**Case Citation:** Quebec (Attorney General) v. Senneville, 2025 SCC 33 (Supreme Court of Canada)
**Date of Decision:** October 31, 2025

**1. Facts of the Case:**
The case involved Louis-Pier Senneville and Mathieu Naud, who both pleaded guilty to child pornography offenses (possession and accessing). They challenged the constitutionality of the one-year mandatory minimum sentences prescribed for these indictable offenses under sections 163.1(4)(a) and 163.1(4.1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The sentencing judge and the Quebec Court of Appeal found these mandatory minimums to be grossly disproportionate and thus unconstitutional under section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Attorney General of Quebec appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

**2. Legal Issues:**
The central legal issue was whether the one-year mandatory minimum sentences for possessing and accessing child pornography violate section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (protection against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment).

**3. Arguments of Parties:**
*   **Attorney General of Quebec:** Argued that the mandatory minimum sentences were constitutional.
*   **Senneville and Naud:** Contended that the mandatory minimum sentences were unconstitutional as they could lead to grossly disproportionate punishment across the broad range of conduct covered by the offenses, even in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios.
*   **Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) (Intervener):** Emphasized that a proportionate sentence must consider specific circumstances and that parole eligibility is irrelevant to a section 12 analysis. The CCLA argued that mandatory minimums often undermine proportionality.

**4. Court's Judgment:**
The Supreme Court of Canada, in a 5-4 decision, dismissed the appeal, declaring the mandatory minimum sentences for possessing and accessing child pornography unconstitutional.
*   **Majority Opinion (Justice Moreau):** A mandatory minimum sentence violates section 12 if it leads to grossly disproportionate punishment for the accused or for an offender in a reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenario. The majority used a hypothetical example of an 18-year-old receiving a 'sext' from a 17-year-old girlfriend, which technically constitutes child pornography, to illustrate how the broad scope of the offenses risked imposing grossly disproportionate sentences. The decision reaffirmed proportionality in sentencing.
*   **Dissenting Opinion (Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Côté):** Would have allowed the appeal, arguing that cruel and unusual punishment had not been demonstrated and questioned the 'reasonable' nature of the majority's hypothetical scenario.

**5. Potential Legal and Social Impact:**
*   **Proportionality in Sentencing:** Reaffirms the importance of proportionality in sentencing and provides a framework for challenging mandatory minimum sentences under section 12 of the Charter, especially when applied to a broad spectrum of conduct.
*   **Future Challenges to Mandatory Minimums:** Likely to influence future constitutional challenges to other mandatory minimum sentences in the Criminal Code.
*   **Focus on Individualized Sentencing:** Reinforces the need for courts to consider a fit and proportionate sentence for both the individual before the court and for offenders in reasonably foreseeable scenarios, moving away from rigid sentencing where broad offenses are concerned.
*   **CSAEM Offenses:** While acknowledging the severe harm caused by child sexual abuse and exploitation material (CSAEM) offenses, the decision distinguishes this from the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence, focusing on the legal principle of proportionality.
