**Subject: PSA: The Ducks in the Park Are Judging You**

Okay, stop everything. We need to have a serious talk about ducks. I’ve just stumbled upon some classified information, and it turns out we've been underestimating them this whole time.

For starters, they can see you from basically every angle. With their 340-degree vision, that duck you thought was minding its own business is actually watching you try to parallel park from across the street. And don't think you can sneak up on them when they're sleeping. They literally sleep with one eye open, with one half of their brain remaining wide awake, probably critiquing your outfit.

And they're gossiping about you, too. Apparently, ducks have regional accents. I’m now convinced the loud, obnoxious quacking from the city ducks is just them shouting about the price of organic bread, while their country cousins are politely whispering about the weather. But if you think they're judging your financial choices, wait until you hear about their love lives.

Their dating life is also way more complicated than ours. The males have to perform intense, choreographed dance numbers to win a mate. Think head-bobbing, tail-shaking, synchronized bill-dipping routines. So next time you feel awkward on a first date, just be glad you don’t have to do that. And without getting into the anatomical specifics, let's just say things down there are a 'complex, corkscrewed' situation for them. It’s an evolutionary arms race I want no part of.

On top of all that, they're emotionally and physically impervious. They have a special gland that makes their feathers totally waterproof, meaning your desperate pleas for approval literally roll right off their backs. And to process the sheer audacity of our life choices, they eat gravel. Seriously. They swallow rocks to help them digest, which is the toughest, most judgmental thing I've ever heard.

So, the next time you're at the pond, toss them some peas (not bread, you amateur) and know that you are in the presence of stone-cold, rock-eating, waterproof dance champions with 340-degree vision. Don't make any sudden moves. They've already seen it. And they are not impressed.
