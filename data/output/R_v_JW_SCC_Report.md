## Legal Report: R. v. JW, 2025 SCC 16

**Date of Decision:** May 23, 2025
**Appeal Heard:** December 3, 2024

### Facts:
J.W., a 28-year-old member of the Attawapiskat First Nation, suffering from schizophrenia and other cognitive disorders, sexually assaulted, threatened, and unlawfully confined an overnight worker in May 2018. He pleaded guilty to these charges. During a four-year remand period, J.W. spent 812 days in remand centers and 607 days in a psychiatric hospital (Providence Care Hospital). The Ontario Superior Court of Justice imposed a nine-year penitentiary term in April 2022, granting 1.5:1 credit for remand days but denying enhanced credit for time in the psychiatric hospital due to J.W.'s serial discharge of counsel, deemed 'wrongful conduct'. The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, correcting only a calculation error.

### Legal Issues:
1.  Whether a sentencing judge may consider the time an offender is likely to need to complete institutional programming when determining a fit sentence.
2.  Whether self-generated procedural delays, such as frequently discharging counsel, constitute 'wrongful conduct' that disqualifies an accused from enhanced pre-sentence credit under section 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code.
3.  Whether the qualitative hardship rationale for enhanced credit applies to detention in a mental-health facility.

### Court's Decision:
The Supreme Court upheld the nine-year sentence but restored 1.5-for-1 credit for the days J.W. spent in the psychiatric hospital. The Court found no error in principle by the sentencing judge considering institutional programming time when determining a fit sentence. However, it refined the meaning of 'wrongful conduct' for denying enhanced pre-sentence credit, ruling that J.W.'s procedural delays did not meet this definition. The Court also affirmed that the qualitative hardship rationale for enhanced credit applies to detention in a mental health facility.

### Implications:
The decision in *R. v. JW* is significant for several reasons:
*   It clarifies the extent to which sentencing judges can account for institutional programming time, which will impact trial-level sentencing practices.
*   It re-balances proportionality, rehabilitation, and restraint by refining the definition of 'wrongful conduct' for denying enhanced pre-sentence credit, particularly benefiting individuals with mental health issues.
*   Defence counsel may now be more inclined to subpoena Correctional Service Canada (CSC) data on program capacity, potentially leading to greater transparency in sentencing.
*   The Court highlighted the seriousness of sexual violence against Indigenous women, aligning with parliamentary directives to prioritize denunciation in such cases and aiming to bolster public confidence in the justice system by balancing offender illness with victim safety.
