### Comprehensive Report on Ontario (Attorney General) v. Working Families Coalition (Canada) Inc., 2025 SCC 5

**Case Citation:** Ontario (Attorney General) v. Working Families Coalition (Canada) Inc., 2025 SCC 5 (Supreme Court of Canada)
**Date of Decision:** March 7, 2025

**1. Facts of the Case:**
The case originated from a challenge to Section 37.10.1(2) of Ontario's Election Finances Act (EFA), which imposed spending limits on third parties for political advertising during the 12-month period preceding a provincial election. Specifically, it limited spending to $24,000 in any electoral district and $600,000 overall. The Working Families Coalition, a civil society organization, and several unions challenged these limits, arguing they infringed upon their rights.

**2. Legal Issues:**
The central legal issue was whether the third-party spending limits in Section 37.10.1(2) of the EFA infringed upon Section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (right to vote and participate in the electoral process), and if so, whether such an infringement could be justified under Section 1 of the Charter.

**3. Arguments of Parties:**
*   **Working Families Coalition and Unions (Respondents):** Argued that the spending limits were overly restrictive, hindering their ability to engage in political discourse and inform the public, thereby infringing on the right to an informed vote and meaningful participation guaranteed by Section 3 of the Charter. They contended that the legislation created a disproportionate political discourse.
*   **Attorney General of Ontario (Appellant):** Argued that the spending limits were a reasonable measure to promote an egalitarian model of elections, ensure fairness, and protect the integrity of the election process, as well as the primary role of political parties. They asserted that the objective was pressing and substantial and rationally connected to a spending cap.

**4. Court's Judgment:**
The Supreme Court of Canada, in a 5-4 split decision, dismissed the appeal, ruling that Section 37.10.1(2) of Ontario's Election Finances Act was unconstitutional.
*   **Majority Opinion (Justice Andromache Karakatsanis):** Held that the impugned provision breached Section 3 of the Charter by interfering with the right of Ontario citizens to make an informed decision when voting and to meaningfully participate in the electoral process. The majority concluded that the infringement could not be saved under Section 1 of the Charter because the province had not demonstrated that the challenged spending limit minimally impaired Section 3, deeming the length of the restriction period excessively long.
*   **Dissenting Opinions (Chief Justice Wagner, Justice Moreau, Justice Côté, and Justice Rowe):** Argued that the spending limit did not infringe on Section 3, as it was not established that it would deprive citizens of a reasonable opportunity to introduce ideas or become informed. Justices Côté and Rowe further emphasized the distinct nature of Section 3 from freedom of expression under Section 2(b).

**5. Potential Legal and Social Impact:**
*   **Strengthened Democratic Values:** The decision is a landmark judgment that strengthens democratic values and increases protection for political advocacy by third-party groups, underscoring a broad interpretation of the right to vote under the Charter.
*   **Third-Party Advocacy:** Reinforces the importance of allowing third parties a meaningful opportunity to contribute to public discourse, even if it limits government power to regulate political spending.
*   **Election Finance Regulation:** Provides initial guidance on analyzing Section 3 in the context of pre-writ election advertising spending limits. While the specific provision was struck down, the Court did not provide a definitive framework for proportional spending limits, potentially leading to further legislative adjustments and judicial scrutiny in election finance regulation.
