### Comprehensive Report on R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15

**Case Citation:** R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15 (Supreme Court of Canada)
**Date of Decision:** March 15, 2019

**1. Facts of the Case:**
Douglas Morrison posted an online advertisement seeking sexual conversations with younger girls. An undercover police officer, posing as a 14-year-old girl ('Mia'), responded. Over two months, they engaged in sexually explicit online conversations, during which Morrison asked 'Mia' to touch herself sexually and proposed an in-person meeting for sexual acts. Morrison was charged with child luring under section 172.1 of the Criminal Code. At trial, he claimed he believed he was communicating with an adult woman who was pretending to be 14.

**2. Legal Issues:**
Morrison challenged the constitutionality of three provisions within section 172.1 of the Criminal Code under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:
*   **Presumption of Belief (s. 172.1(3)):** Argued violation of the right to be presumed innocent (s. 11(d) of the Charter).
*   **Reasonable Steps Defence (s. 172.1(4)):** Contended violation of principles of fundamental justice (s. 7 of the Charter) due to potentially allowing convictions based on objective fault.
*   **Mandatory Minimum Sentence (s. 172.1(2)(a)):** Argued it constituted cruel and unusual punishment (s. 12 of the Charter).

**3. Arguments of Parties:**
*   **Morrison (Accused):** Argued the presumption of belief allowed conviction despite reasonable doubt about his actual belief of age. Claimed the 'reasonable steps' requirement violated section 7 by leading to convictions based on objective fault. Submitted the mandatory minimum sentence could result in grossly disproportionate sentences, violating section 12.
*   **Crown:** Argued for the constitutionality of the provisions, emphasizing the objective of protecting children from sexual exploitation. Contended the provisions were rationally connected and proportionate to this objective.

**4. Court's Judgment:**
The Supreme Court of Canada delivered its judgment on March 15, 2019.
*   **Presumption of Belief (s. 172.1(3)):** Unanimously ruled unconstitutional, violating section 11(d) of the Charter (presumption of innocence). The Court found it could not be saved under section 1. (Justice Moldaver for the majority).
*   **Reasonable Steps (s. 172.1(4)):** The majority found the provision itself constitutional but clarified its application: failure to take reasonable steps is not sufficient for conviction; the Crown must still prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused *believed* the person was underage. The defence of honest belief in legal age requires the accused to present some evidence of having taken reasonable steps and genuinely believing the person was of legal age.
*   **Mandatory Minimum Sentence (s. 172.1(2)(a)):** The majority declined to rule on its constitutionality, citing lower courts' misunderstanding of the law's operation. However, Justice Karakatsanis (concurring) and Justice Abella (dissenting in part) would have found it unconstitutional under section 12.
*   **Outcome:** Morrison's conviction was set aside, and a new trial was ordered due to errors by the trial judge in applying the law.

**5. Potential Legal and Social Impact:**
The *R. v. Morrison* decision significantly impacted the prosecution of child luring cases, particularly those involving police sting operations.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Reaffirmed the presumption of innocence, requiring the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused *believed* the other person was underage or was wilfully blind to that fact. The mere online representation of age no longer automatically creates a presumption of belief.
*   **'Reasonable Steps' Defence:** Clarified that while the 'reasonable steps' provision remains, conviction cannot solely be based on failure to take such steps; subjective belief remains central.
*   **Future Cases:** The ruling necessitated changes in how prosecution approaches child luring cases, with a clearer burden on proving the accused's subjective intent. The constitutional question regarding the mandatory minimum sentence was left open for future challenges, indicating potential for further litigation in this area.
