Here is a short profile for Captain Comet:

**Name:** Captain Comet

**Profile:** Captain Comet is a beacon of hope, empowered by an extraordinary cosmic phenomenon – pure, self-sustaining renewable energy, mirroring the clean energy ambitions of Earth's Project Atlas on a galactic scale. This stellar force grants him unmatched super-speed, the ability to generate powerful, azure energy blasts, and flight across the furthest reaches of space. His iconic, cobalt-blue suit leaves a dazzling, comet-like trail as he soars through the cosmos.

**Weakness:** While immensely powerful, Captain Comet's unique energy signature is highly susceptible to chaotic, localized fields of exotic matter. Exposure to such interference can rapidly destabilize and drain his cosmic connection, leaving him vulnerable and temporarily powerless.
