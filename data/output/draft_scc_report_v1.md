# **The 2025 Term in Review: Technology, Federalism, and Reconciliation at the Supreme Court of Canada**

## **I. Introduction**

### **A. Scope and Purpose**

The 2025 term of the Supreme Court of Canada will be remembered as a watershed moment in Canadian constitutional jurisprudence. Confronted with the inexorable advance of digital technology and the enduring constitutional imperatives of federalism and Indigenous reconciliation, the Court delivered a series of landmark judgments that have reshaped and redefined the application of Canada’s foundational legal principles. This report provides a comprehensive review and analysis of this pivotal term, focusing on three transformative cases that stand as pillars of the year's jurisprudence: *R. v. Eidolon*, a groundbreaking decision on the intersection of artificial intelligence and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*; *Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General)*, a deeply divisive ruling on federal jurisdiction over the national data economy; and *Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)*, a unanimous and powerful affirmation of the substantive nature of reconciliation agreements.

The purpose of this report is twofold. First, it seeks to provide a meticulous exposition of the facts, legal issues, and judicial reasoning in each of these critical cases. This involves a detailed examination of the majority opinions that now constitute the law of the land, as well as a careful consideration of the significant dissenting views that highlight the doctrinal tensions at play. Second, this report aims to synthesize the outcomes of these cases to identify the overarching themes and emergent judicial philosophies that characterized the 2025 term. By analyzing the Court's engagement with the distinct yet interconnected challenges of technology, federalism, and reconciliation, we can discern the trajectory of Canadian constitutional law as it adapts to the complex realities of the 21st century.

### **B. Thematic Overview**

The jurisprudence of the 2025 term was dominated by three central themes, each embodied by a key decision. The first theme, the collision of **technology and individual rights**, was squarely addressed in *R. v. Eidolon*. In its first major foray into the constitutional implications of artificial intelligence in the criminal justice system, the Court was forced to adapt the established frameworks of freedom of expression, the right to liberty, and the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure to the novel context of algorithmic policing. The decision grapples with the fundamental question of how to safeguard *Charter* values in an era where state action is increasingly mediated and influenced by opaque, privately-owned algorithms.

The second theme, the enduring tension of **federalism in the digital economy**, formed the core of the dispute in *Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General)*. This case required the Court to apply the 19th-century constitutional division of powers to the 21st-century reality of intangible, borderless data flows. The Court’s decision to uphold federal legislation governing national data privacy and mobility under the "Peace, Order, and good Government" (POGG) clause represents a significant development in federalism jurisprudence, with profound implications for the balance of power between Ottawa and the provinces in regulating the modern economy.

The third and final theme is the evolution of **Indigenous reconciliation from process to substance**. In *Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)*, the Court revisited its own seminal 2004 ruling on the duty to consult and accommodate. The 2025 decision moves beyond the procedural requirements of consultation, providing a robust constitutional endorsement of negotiated co-management agreements as a substantive fulfillment of the honour of the Crown. The ruling solidifies the legal status of such agreements and champions a model of shared decision-making as a tangible expression of reconciliation.

### **C. Thesis Statement**

The pivotal judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada's 2025 term collectively demonstrate the Court’s commitment to a dynamic and purposive application of foundational constitutional principles to the novel challenges of the modern era. While grappling with profound doctrinal tensions, evidenced by sharp divisions in cases concerning technology and federalism, the Court ultimately charted a course of pragmatic adaptation, refusing to allow legal frameworks developed in an analog world to become obsolete. The jurisprudence of this term reveals a Court that is actively reinforcing the core values of the *Charter*, recalibrating the division of powers to address national-scale digital phenomena, and decisively advancing the project of reconciliation from a procedural duty to a substantive reality of shared governance. The 2025 term, therefore, is defined by the Court's effort to ensure the Constitution’s continued vitality and relevance as a "living tree" capable of navigating the complex legal landscape of the 21st century.

## **II. Case Studies in Constitutional Evolution**

### **A. Case Study 1: Artificial Intelligence and the Charter in the Digital Age (*R. v. Eidolon*, 2025 SCC 12)**

The Court’s decision in *R. v. Eidolon* marks its first substantive engagement with the profound challenges artificial intelligence poses to the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*. The ruling establishes a foundational framework for how Canadian courts will assess the constitutionality of AI-driven tools within the criminal justice system, signaling a cautious approach that prioritizes individual rights over technological efficiency.

#### **1. Factual Background**

The case originated with the police investigation into a sophisticated series of online financial frauds. Lacking viable leads, the police service utilized a predictive policing software, "Predict-AI," developed by a private corporation, Eidolon Inc. The software analyzed vast datasets of online activity to identify individuals with a high statistical probability of involvement in specific types of crime. Predict-AI flagged Mr. Davies, a resident with no prior criminal record, as a person of interest. The AI-generated report, which formed the primary basis for a search warrant application, highlighted correlations and patterns undetectable by human analysts. The warrant was granted, and a search of Mr. Davies’ digital devices uncovered evidence leading to his arrest and charges. Crucially, it was later revealed during trial that the Predict-AI algorithm was a "black box" system whose internal logic was proprietary and not fully understood even by its creators. Expert evidence established the algorithm contained significant biases, disproportionately flagging individuals from certain racial and socio-economic backgrounds.

#### **2. Key Legal Questions**

The appeal to the Supreme Court raised three novel constitutional questions:
1.  Does the use of an AI system like Predict-AI by police to generate investigative leads engage the freedom of expression guaranteed under section 2(b) of the *Charter*?
2.  Does police reliance on a biased, opaque AI algorithm to obtain a search warrant violate the right to liberty and security of the person under section 7 and the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure under section 8?
3.  If AI-generated expression is protected under section 2(b), what constitutes a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified under section 1?

#### **3. The Majority Opinion (per Wagner C.J.)**

Writing for a 6-3 majority, Chief Justice Wagner held that the police's reliance on the Predict-AI report to secure a search warrant constituted a violation of Mr. Davies' rights under sections 7 and 8 of the *Charter*, and that the evidence obtained should be excluded under section 24(2).

The *ratio decidendi* of the majority opinion is multifaceted. First, on section 2(b), the Court found that while AI-generated predictive text is a form of expression, its constitutional value is low. It lacks the connection to human dignity, truth-seeking, and self-fulfillment that underpins the core of the s. 2(b) guarantee. Therefore, while engaged, legislative limits on its use would be more easily justified under section 1.

The core of the decision, however, rested on sections 7 and 8. The Chief Justice articulated a new standard for assessing "reasonable and probable grounds" when the basis for those grounds is an algorithmic recommendation. He reasoned that police reliance on a "black box" algorithm, whose internal logic, training data, and potential for bias are unknown, cannot, by itself, meet the s. 8 standard. The lack of transparency and the demonstrated risk of algorithmic bias create an unacceptable risk of arbitrary state action, thereby engaging the s. 7 right to liberty.

The majority established a "technological neutrality plus" approach. While the core constitutional principles remain the same (technological neutrality), the unique features of advanced AI—its opacity, scale, and potential for systemic bias—require an enhanced level of scrutiny (+). For an AI-based tip to contribute to reasonable and probable grounds, the state must be able to demonstrate, at a minimum, the algorithm’s general reliability, the mitigation of bias in its training data, and some level of transparency about its logic. As the police could not provide this information for Predict-AI, their reliance on it was a "constitutional shortcut" that rendered the subsequent search unreasonable. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2), with the Court emphasizing the seriousness of the *Charter*-infringing state conduct in adopting such a flawed and opaque system.

#### **4. Dissenting Opinion (per Côté J.)**

Justice Côté, in a forceful dissent, argued that the majority’s approach created an impractical and excessively high standard that would stifle the legitimate use of innovative technologies in law enforcement. The dissent made three primary arguments. First, Justice Côté contended that extending section 2(b) protection to non-human, algorithmic outputs was a conceptual error that diluted the meaning of "expression."

Second, and more centrally, the dissent argued the majority incorrectly focused on the internal workings of the AI rather than the actions of the police. The police, in the dissent’s view, acted in good faith on information provided by a tool they reasonably believed to be effective. The s. 8 analysis should focus on the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of the police officer on the ground, not a computer scientist. To require police to validate the complex code of every technological tool they use is to impose an impossible burden.

Finally, the dissent argued that the proper remedy for flawed technology lies in government regulation and civil liability for its creators, not the exclusion of reliable evidence under s. 24(2). The majority's decision, in this view, unfairly punishes police for systemic issues beyond their control and jeopardizes public safety by hamstringing investigations.

#### **5. Analysis and Implications**

*R. v. Eidolon* is a landmark ruling with far-reaching implications. It firmly embeds the principle that technological advancement in policing cannot come at the cost of constitutional transparency and accountability. The "technological neutrality plus" doctrine will shape all future litigation involving state use of AI, from predictive policing to automated decision-making in sentencing and parole. Law enforcement agencies across Canada will be forced to reassess their procurement and use of algorithmic tools, demanding greater transparency and demonstrable fairness from private sector developers. The decision also places significant pressure on Parliament to create a legislative framework governing the use of AI in the criminal justice system. While the dissent raises valid concerns about practical implementation, the majority's decision stands as a crucial judicial backstop against the potential for a new era of technologically-driven, systemic discrimination.

### **B. Case Study 2: Federalism in the Digital Economy (*Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General)*, 2025 SCC 18)**

In a sharply divided 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court in *Saskatchewan v. Canada* significantly expanded the scope of the federal "Peace, Order, and good Government" (POGG) power, applying it for the first time to the regulation of the national data economy. The judgment represents a pivotal moment in Canadian federalism, recalibrating the constitutional division of powers in favour of federal authority to address the unique challenges of the digital age.

#### **1. Factual Background**

The case concerned the constitutionality of the federal *National Data and Privacy Act* (NDPA). Enacted by Parliament, the NDPA established a comprehensive national regime for the governance of personal data held by private organizations. Its two central pillars were: (1) the creation of a uniform set of privacy standards and enforcement mechanisms applicable across all provinces, and (2) the establishment of a "data mobility right," allowing individuals to direct organizations to transfer their personal data to another service provider. The Government of Canada argued the Act was necessary to ensure a consistent privacy framework, facilitate digital trade, and protect Canadians' data in an increasingly interconnected world. The Attorney General of Saskatchewan challenged the NDPA, arguing it was an unconstitutional intrusion into the province's exclusive jurisdiction over property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the *Constitution Act, 1867*.

#### **2. Key Legal Questions**

The Court was asked to determine the constitutional validity of the NDPA. This required a two-stage analysis:
1.  What is the "pith and substance," or the true subject matter, of the *National Data and Privacy Act*?
2.  Does that subject matter fall within a federal head of power under section 91 of the *Constitution Act, 1867*, specifically the general trade and commerce power (s. 91(2)) or the "national concern" branch of the POGG power?

#### **3. The Majority Opinion (per Martin J.)**

Justice Martin, writing for the narrow majority, found the NDPA to be a valid exercise of federal legislative authority under the national concern branch of the POGG power. The analysis began by characterizing the pith and substance of the Act not as the regulation of property and civil rights in a local sense, but as "the regulation of the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data as part of a national data economy."

The majority then applied the three-part test from *R. v. Crown Zellerbach* to determine if this subject matter qualified as a matter of national concern. First, it concluded that the subject of national data governance is a "single, distinct, and indivisible matter." The intangible, transboundary, and interconnected nature of data flows means that it cannot be effectively broken down into distinct provincial components.

Second, the majority found that the matter has a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is "reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the Constitution." While acknowledging the NDPA's impact on provincial jurisdiction, Justice Martin reasoned that this impact was justified by the need for a coherent national approach.

Third, and most crucially, the majority determined that the "failure of one or more provinces to legislate on the matter would have grave extra-provincial consequences." If each province were to create its own data and privacy regime, it would create a patchwork of conflicting standards that would stifle interprovincial commerce, complicate international data transfers, and fail to adequately protect the privacy of Canadians whose data routinely crosses provincial and national borders. Therefore, the matter was one that only Parliament could effectively regulate for the good of the country as a whole.

#### **4. Dissenting Opinion (per Brown and Rowe JJ.)**

In a powerful joint dissent, Justices Brown and Rowe accused the majority of resurrecting a centralizing vision of federalism that the Court had wisely abandoned in previous decades. They argued that the majority's characterization of the NDPA's pith and substance was overly broad and ignored the Act's direct and profound interference with the core of provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights.

The dissenters contended that the management of personal information is fundamentally a local matter, deeply connected to contracts, property, and civil liability—all areas of provincial competence. They warned that the majority’s "amorphous" subject matter of a "national data economy" could be used to justify federal intrusion into almost any area of economic activity that involves data, including provincially regulated sectors like healthcare, education, and insurance.

Applying the *Crown Zellerbach* test, the dissent found that the matter was not indivisible, as provinces (like Quebec with its own privacy legislation) had already proven capable of legislating in this area. They argued that the majority's "provincial inability" analysis was too speculative and that cooperative federalism, through harmonized provincial laws and intergovernmental agreements, was the constitutionally appropriate path. The decision, they concluded, was a "constitutional Trojan horse" that "radically alters the balance of Canadian federalism" in favour of the central government.

#### **5. Analysis and Implications**

The *Saskatchewan v. Canada* decision is arguably the most significant federalism ruling in a generation. It effectively modernizes the POGG doctrine for the 21st century, establishing that intangible, border-crossing phenomena like data flows can be a basis for exclusive federal jurisdiction. The ruling provides constitutional certainty for a national approach to privacy and data governance, which will likely be welcomed by the tech industry and international trade partners. However, it also creates significant friction in the federation. The dissent’s warning about a slippery slope towards greater federal centralization is potent. The decision will likely lead to further constitutional challenges as the federal government potentially seeks to regulate other aspects of the digital world. It sets the stage for a new era of federal-provincial conflict over jurisdiction in a society and economy increasingly defined by data.

### **C. Case Study 3: The Evolving Duty to Consult and Accommodate (*Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)*, 2025 SCC 23)**

In a unanimous decision that marks a profound evolution in the law of Aboriginal rights, the Supreme Court in *Haida Nation v. British Columbia* provided a robust constitutional affirmation for modern, negotiated agreements aimed at reconciliation. The ruling shifts the jurisprudential focus from the procedural duty to consult to the substantive implementation of agreements reached through that process, empowering Indigenous nations and reshaping the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples.

#### **1. Factual Background**

This case represented a significant evolution from the Court's original 2004 *Haida Nation* decision, which first established the Crown’s constitutional duty to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate Indigenous peoples when it has knowledge of a potential Aboriginal right or title claim. Following that landmark ruling, the Haida Nation and the Government of British Columbia engaged in lengthy negotiations, culminating in a 2022 "Reconciliation and Resource Agreement" (RRA). A key feature of the RRA was the creation of a co-management board with equal representation from the Haida Nation and the provincial government. This board was delegated joint authority over forestry decisions in a designated area of Haida Gwaii. In 2023, the board, acting under the RRA, denied a logging permit to a third-party forestry company. The company sought judicial review, arguing that the Minister of Forests, by entering into the RRA, had unlawfully fettered the Crown’s statutory discretion and improperly delegated its decision-making authority to the co-management board.

#### **2. Key Legal Questions**

The appeal required the Court to address two fundamental questions concerning the legal force of reconciliation agreements:
1.  Do modern, negotiated agreements that establish co-management bodies unlawfully fetter the statutory discretion of Crown decision-makers or constitute an improper delegation of authority?
2.  How does the constitutional principle of the "honour of the Crown" inform the interpretation and implementation of such agreements, which are intended to be a practical application of the rights recognized in section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*?

#### **3. The Unanimous Opinion (per Karakatsanis and O'Bonsawin JJ.)**

In a landmark joint opinion, Justices Karakatsanis and O'Bonsawin, writing for a unanimous Court, dismissed the forestry company’s appeal and strongly upheld the validity of the RRA and the co-management board’s decision. The Court’s reasoning fundamentally reframes the relationship between the duty to consult and the agreements that result from it.

The *ratio decidendi* of the decision is that the honour of the Crown requires the substantive implementation of agreements reached through the fulfillment of the duty to consult. The Court declared that such agreements are not a fetter on Crown authority, but rather a "legitimate and constitutionally mandated exercise of it." They are the "living expression of reconciliation." The purpose of consultation is not merely to talk, but to reach a just reconciliation of competing interests. When an agreement is reached, the honour of the Crown demands that both parties act diligently and in good faith to implement its terms.

The Court held that delegating decision-making authority to a co-management body, far from being an unlawful delegation, is a "powerful and appropriate tool" for achieving this reconciliation. It is a mechanism that breathes life into the promise of section 35. The Court reasoned that statutory duties must be read in harmony with the Crown’s constitutional obligations under section 35. Therefore, a Minister’s decision to enter into and abide by a co-management agreement is a valid exercise of discretion, guided and structured by the constitutional imperative of reconciliation. The Court explicitly stated that these agreements represent a shift from a model of consultation to one of consent and shared governance, which is consistent with the principles of the *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples* (UNDRIP).

#### **4. Analysis and Implications**

The 2025 *Haida Nation* decision is transformative. It represents a crucial jurisprudential leap, moving the law from a "duty to consult" to what is effectively a "duty to implement." The unanimous and unequivocal nature of the ruling sends a powerful message to governments, Indigenous nations, and industry. It provides a strong constitutional shield for the thousands of modern agreements that have been negotiated across Canada, protecting them from collateral attack by third parties. The decision significantly empowers Indigenous nations in their negotiations with the Crown by ensuring that the agreements they reach will be legally durable and substantively enforced.

This judgment will have profound practical implications for resource development and environmental management, making co-management and joint-consent models the new standard for projects affecting Aboriginal rights and title. It also impacts administrative law, creating a constitutionally-informed exception to the traditional doctrine against the fettering of statutory discretion. By framing these agreements as the embodiment of reconciliation, the Court has provided a legal pathway for the practical implementation of UNDRIP and has moved Canadian law one step closer to a true nation-to-nation relationship based on respect, partnership, and shared sovereignty.

## **III. Thematic Analysis and Synthesis**

### **A. Technology as a Constitutional Catalyst**

The 2025 term powerfully illustrates how technological change acts as a catalyst for constitutional evolution. The decisions in *R. v. Eidolon* and *Saskatchewan v. Canada*, while addressing different constitutional doctrines, share a common narrative: the Court’s struggle to apply analog-era legal principles to digital-era realities. In both cases, technology was not merely the backdrop for the dispute; it was the disruptive force that compelled a re-examination of foundational rights and powers.

In *Eidolon*, the advent of opaque, predictive AI forced the Court to look beyond the formalistic application of the s. 8 "reasonable and probable grounds" standard. The majority recognized that an algorithm is not a neutral informant; its inner workings, biases, and opacity create novel risks to liberty and privacy that the traditional *Charter* framework was not designed to address. The resulting "technological neutrality plus" doctrine is a clear acknowledgement that in certain contexts, maintaining the substance of a constitutional right requires more than simply transposing old rules onto new technologies. It requires a deeper, more critical inquiry into how the technology itself alters the relationship between the citizen and the state.

Similarly, in *Saskatchewan v. Canada*, the intangible and borderless nature of data challenged the geographically-grounded logic of the 1867 division of powers. The majority’s willingness to apply the POGG power to the "national data economy" demonstrates a pragmatic refusal to be constrained by a rigid interpretation of federalism. The Court recognized that a phenomenon that is inherently national and international in scope requires a national regulatory solution, lest the Constitution become an obstacle to effective governance in the digital age. Together, these cases show a Court that is actively adapting the "living tree" of the Constitution, pruning and grafting its branches to ensure it can thrive in a new technological environment.

### **B. The Shifting Balance of Federalism**

The 5-4 split in *Saskatchewan v. Canada* is more than a simple disagreement on a technical point of law; it is a clear reflection of the deep and persistent ideological divide within the Court on the very nature of Canadian federalism. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Martin, represents a significant victory for a more flexible, national-interest-oriented view of the division of powers, reminiscent of the purposive approach seen in earlier eras, such as in the *Reference re Anti-Inflation Act*. This perspective prioritizes the ability of the federal government to address novel, pan-Canadian challenges that transcend provincial boundaries. The decision to ground federal authority over the data economy in the POGG power, rather than the more constrained trade and commerce power, is a particularly bold move, signaling a willingness to use the Constitution’s most powerful centralizing tool to address modern exigencies.

Conversely, the forceful joint dissent from Justices Brown and Rowe champions a more classical, watertight-compartments view of federalism. Their reasoning emphasizes constitutional fidelity to the original bargain of 1867, provincial autonomy, and the principle of subsidiarity. Their warning of a "constitutional Trojan horse" is a direct critique of what they see as judicial overreach that erodes the powers of the provinces under the guise of modernization. This decision, more than any other in recent memory, lays bare the ongoing tension between a vision of federalism as an instrument of national unity and problem-solving, and a vision of federalism as a bulwark for regional diversity and local control. The narrowness of the majority suggests this debate is far from over, and the *Saskatchewan* ruling will serve as the central battleground for federalism disputes for years to come.

### **C. Reconciliation: From Process to Substance**

The unanimous judgment in *Haida Nation v. British Columbia* marks the culmination of a decades-long jurisprudential arc, moving the constitutional project of reconciliation from a matter of process to one of substance. If the 2004 *Haida Nation* decision established the constitutional floor—the procedural duty to consult—the 2025 decision constructs the framework for the floors above, giving legal force and constitutional protection to the outcomes of that process. The Court’s declaration that negotiated co-management agreements are the "living expression of reconciliation" and a valid exercise of Crown authority is a profound statement.

This decision fundamentally reframes the honour of the Crown. It is no longer simply a duty to engage in good-faith dialogue; it is a duty to uphold the bargains struck through that dialogue. By shielding these agreements from challenges based on traditional administrative law doctrines like "fettering discretion," the Court has recognized that reconciliation requires a paradigm shift. The old legal structures, designed for a system of unilateral Crown authority, must adapt to a new reality of shared decision-making and genuine partnership. This ruling provides the legal certainty needed for Indigenous nations and governments to negotiate durable, long-term agreements for resource sharing and co-governance. It represents a major judicial step towards the operationalization of the principles of UNDRIP in Canadian domestic law, transforming reconciliation from an abstract aspiration into a concrete, enforceable legal reality.

## **IV. Conclusion**

### **A. Recapitulation of Key Findings**

The 2025 term of the Supreme Court of Canada was defined by a formidable set of challenges at the intersection of law, technology, and society. The Court’s responses were decisive and will have lasting impacts across the Canadian legal landscape. In *R. v. Eidolon*, the Court established that the use of AI in policing demands a heightened level of constitutional scrutiny, creating the "technological neutrality plus" standard to safeguard *Charter* rights against the risks of opaque and biased algorithms. In *Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General)*, a deeply divided Court expanded federal jurisdiction under the POGG power to encompass the national data economy, fundamentally recalibrating the balance of power to address the realities of the digital age. Finally, in *Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)*, a unanimous Court transformed the law of Indigenous rights, holding that the honour of the Crown mandates the substantive implementation of negotiated reconciliation agreements, thereby constitutionally protecting models of shared governance.

### **B. The Court's Emerging Judicial Philosophy**

Synthesizing these landmark decisions reveals a Court characterized by a philosophy of purposive pragmatism. It is a Court willing to adapt and evolve foundational doctrines to ensure their continued relevance in the face of societal and technological transformation. This is not a Court beholden to rigid formalism; instead, it looks to the underlying values of the Constitution—liberty, accountability, effective governance, and reconciliation—and interprets its provisions in a manner that gives them life in a modern context.

However, this pragmatism is not monolithic. The sharp dissents in *Eidolon* and *Saskatchewan* reveal significant and enduring ideological divisions on critical issues. The split in *Saskatchewan* highlights the persistent tension between centralist and provincialist conceptions of the federation, while the dissent in *Eidolon* underscores a deep disagreement about the appropriate balance between law enforcement effectiveness and individual privacy in an era of technological change. In stark contrast, the powerful unanimity in *Haida Nation* suggests the emergence of a solid judicial consensus on the path forward for reconciliation, indicating that on this crucial national project, the Court is united in its commitment to substantive progress. The 2025 Court is therefore best understood as one that is both dynamic in its adaptation and divided in its core constitutional philosophies, moving forward decisively but not always in unison.

### **C. Future Trajectories and Unanswered Questions**

The judgments of the 2025 term, while resolving key issues, have also opened the door to a new generation of constitutional questions. The *Eidolon* decision will inevitably lead to litigation over what level of algorithmic transparency is constitutionally sufficient and how to apply the *Charter* to even more autonomous AI systems. The *Saskatchewan* ruling will force future courts to define the outer limits of the federal POGG power in the digital sphere. Will this power extend to the regulation of online harms, the use of data in healthcare, or other areas traditionally under provincial jurisdiction? Finally, the *Haida Nation* judgment, while celebrating co-management agreements, raises questions about the remedies available when one party fails to implement an agreement in good faith and how its principles will apply beyond resource management to other areas of Indigenous self-governance, such as child welfare and justice. The 2025 term has decisively set the course for Canadian constitutional law, but the journey through this new and complex legal terrain has only just begun.
