## Case Analysis: Attorney General of Quebec v. Senneville, 2025 SCC 33

**Date of Decision:** October 31, 2025

**Court:** Supreme Court of Canada

**Overview:**
The Supreme Court of Canada, in a landmark decision, found that mandatory minimum sentences of one year's imprisonment for possession and accessing child pornography, as prescribed by sections 163.1(4)(a) and 163.1(4.1)(a) of the Criminal Code, are unconstitutional. The Court ruled that these provisions violate section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, as they could lead to grossly disproportionate punishment in reasonably foreseeable scenarios.

**Facts:**
The case involved two separate appeals: Mr. Senneville and Mr. Naud, both of whom pleaded guilty to child pornography offenses. Mr. Senneville pleaded guilty to one count of possession and one count of accessing child pornography, involving 475 files, with 317 images depicting child pornography, primarily of young girls aged 3 to 6. Mr. Naud pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography. Both challenged the constitutionality of the one-year mandatory minimum sentences. The sentencing judge and the Court of Appeal both agreed, finding the sentences unconstitutional.

**Legal Issues:**
The core legal issue was whether the mandatory minimum sentences for child pornography offenses (sections 163.1(4)(a) and 163.1(4.1)(a) of the Criminal Code) infringed upon section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by potentially imposing cruel and unusual punishment. The assessment focused on whether these mandatory minimums could result in grossly disproportionate punishment in a reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenario.

**Decision of the Court (Majority):**
A majority of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Moreau (with Justices Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, and Jamal concurring), dismissed the appeal and declared the mandatory minimum sentences unconstitutional. The Court reiterated that a minimum sentence can be unconstitutional if it results in grossly disproportionate punishment, applying the 'reasonably foreseeable scenario' test. Justice Moreau provided an example of an 18-year-old with no prior criminal record who briefly possesses a child pornography image ('sext') sent by a friend, stating that a one-year mandatory minimum in such a context would be grossly disproportionate.

**Dissenting Opinions:**
Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Côté, joined by Justices Rowe and O'Bonsawin, dissented. They argued that the appeal should have been allowed, as it had not been proven that the minimum sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment. They contended that the impugned provisions were constitutionally valid, emphasizing the societal condemnation of child sexual offenses and the need for consistent and rigorous sentencing in this area.

**Legal Implications:**
This decision reaffirms the Supreme Court's stance that mandatory minimum sentences are subject to Charter scrutiny under section 12, particularly concerning proportionality. It underscores the importance of individualized sentencing and the consideration of an offender's specific circumstances to prevent cruel and unusual punishment. The ruling effectively invalidates the one-year mandatory minimums for child sexual exploitation abuse material and could pave the way for further challenges to other mandatory minimum sentences within the Criminal Code, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of such provisions across Canadian law.
